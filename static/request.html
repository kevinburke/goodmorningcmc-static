    Hey there,<br>
        I've been more than thrilled with the success of Good Morning CMC so far; we've currently got 373 subscribers, which is about 1 in 4 students at CMC. Unfortunately, this success has gotten a little pricey. So far I've been using a free account to send out the emails every morning, but as the number of subscribers has gone up, I've ran out of credits on the free account.<br><br>
        
        Last week I requested $100 in funding from Student Senate. I'll use the money to keep Good Morning CMC&nbsp;running until May, and to buy a snazzy new domain name, so I don't have to host Good Morning CMC on my personal site.
        
        <br><Br>The Senate vote is <b>tonight in Bauer Forum at 10PM.</b> If you think Good Morning CMC is cool and want to show your support, I&nbsp;would really appreciate it if you could show up to Bauer Forum, tell the Senate how cool Good Morning CMC&nbsp;is<img src="http://kburke.org/goodmorningcmc/holi_smile_small.jpg" style="float:right;" width="150" height="162" />  and <b>vote to keep Good Morning CMC afloat</b>. It would let me keep doing something that&nbsp;I really enjoy, and that's been a huge success.
        
        
        <br><br>
        Yours truly,<br>
        Kevin
