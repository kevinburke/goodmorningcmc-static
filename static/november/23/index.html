Two quick notes:<br><br>

Thank you to everyone who came to Senate last night to vote. The funding request <a href="http://twitter.com/goodmorningcmc/status/6964536603049984">passed by unanimous vote</a>, so we have enough money to keep Good Morning CMC&nbsp;running through May.<br><br>

Also I am trying to organize an ASCMC trip to go see USA&nbsp;Men's Soccer vs. Chile at the Home Depot Center on January 22. In the past ASCMC&nbsp;has lost money on trips to soccer games so they want to make sure enough people are interested. If you are thinking about not going because 'soccer is boring,' that's a really bad reason - there's a ton of other stuff that makes soccer games really fun, like singing at the top of your lungs, yelling at the ref, drinking on the bus, and seeing all of the other crazy fans. If this is something you would be willing to pay $10 to go to, sign up <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDdqRlNIck5YMHQ5VXF5RC1UbG1uQkE6MQ">here.</a><br><Br>
