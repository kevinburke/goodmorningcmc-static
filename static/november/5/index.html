It's Friday. I turn 22 today, which got me thinking. When I pitched this idea to a few other students at CMC, the responses ranged from "I don't think people would read it" to "I personally do not want any more emails." So I did it anyway. I really didn't expect that 1 out of every 4 students would subcribe, which is a response beyond my highest expectation. Thanks for reading and supporting Good Morning CMC.<br><br>

It would be nice if, as you got older, you got a better sense for what you wanted to do with your life, and found amazing, purpose-defining reasons to jump out of bed in the morning, but sometimes it doesn't turn out that way.<br><br> I do know that there are ten packs of Skittles in my apartment right now, and if you love the red and purple ones, but hate the green, yellow and orange ones, it just might be true love.<br><br>

Yours,<br>
Kevin
