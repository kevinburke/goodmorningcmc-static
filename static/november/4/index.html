<h3>Athenaeum</h3>

Lunch: <b>John West</b>, Author of <i>The Last Goodnights: Assisting My Parents with their Suicides (A Memoir)</i>.

<br><br>Ath opens at 11:30; program begins at 12.<br><br>

Dinner: <b>Hugh Rockoff</b>, economics professor at Rutgers. If you've ever seen the classic movie <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, there's a theory that the movie's plea to "follow the yellow brick road" is an allegory to US monetary policy, that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">should get back onto the gold standard.</a> Rockoff is one of the proponents of this theory. He will be speaking about "The Wizard of Oz as Monetary Allegory."

<br><Br>Ath opens at 5; dinner starts at 6, and the program begins at 6:45.
