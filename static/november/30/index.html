<h3>Athenaeum</h3>

Dinner: <b>Charles Kamm</b>, assistant professor of music at&nbsp;Scripps, will be conducting the Claremont chamber choir. I&nbsp;signed up for this last year but ended up spending the whole time in the back room of the Ath talking with a girl who worked there, we would have dated but then I went to India and the whole thing went to hell. Anyway, pursue serendipity, because you never know. I&nbsp;hear it's a great concert.

<br><Br>Ath opens at 5:30; dinner starts at 6, and the program begins at 6:45.
