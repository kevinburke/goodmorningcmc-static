I bought the domain name <a href="http://goodmorningcmc.com">goodmorningcmc.com</a> last night, so now it's super easy to find Good Morning CMC on the Web. You can also Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=good+morning+cmc">"good morning cmc"</a> or try our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Good-Morning-CMC/113073532088790">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter pages</a>, both of which have links.<br><Br>

A few days ago I received an email from a freshman parent who subscribes to Good Morning CMC to feel more informed about what was going on at her daughter's school, and more connected with activities at the college. You might want to encourage your parents to <a href="http://goodmorningcmc.com">sign up</a> as well.<br><Br>

I would strongly recommend adding an RSS&nbsp;feeds to your daily routine. If you check a ton of different websites that update periodically, like a blog or a news site, RSS&nbsp;is a technology that displays all of the updates from every site in one central place, so you can read through a ton of sites quickly (or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU">watch a short video on RSS for beginners</a>). I started reading RSS&nbsp;feeds before I came to college and I think reading my RSS&nbsp;feed every day has been about as useful as my classes in teaching me about the world. A good RSS&nbsp;reader is <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.<Br><br>

For those of you driving home, you might want to download some podcasts to listen to in the car. Three of my favorites are <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/">Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me</a>, and <a href="http://radiolab.org">Radiolab</a>. You can go through the entire Radiolab archive too. One of my favorite episodes is called <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/apr/05/">Limits</a>.<br><Br>
