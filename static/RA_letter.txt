Hey Jake,

I've been working on a service that I think will be pretty useful for CMC students. I was hoping you could forward the note below along to the students in your dorm. 

Thanks very much,
Kevin

Hey Beckett,
       I'm writing to tell you about my new project, a replacement for the Inform. Everyone knows the Informs suck, they're always full of advertisements for stuff you don't want, they have a horrible format and miss half the events that go on at the 5C's.

I created a daily email, Good Morning CMC, that's designed to be relevant for CMC students. If you sign up, you'll get a daily email telling you about campus events, sports updates, relevant campus news, and what's in the dining halls. Check out the email I sent out this morning here: http://kburke.org/goodmorningcmc/september/15/, or sign up by visiting this link: http://bit.ly/goodmorningcmc/. If you don't want to receive them anymore, you can unsubscribe at any time. You should check it out.

Best,
Kevin
