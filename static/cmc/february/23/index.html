		<div id="ad" style="background-color:#ddd; padding:15px; margin-bottom:10px;">Quick tip: I find events by searching the last 7 days worth of email for words like "tuesday" and, if I have time, "february 23." I also search the 5C Master Calendar, the Chirps and the Informs. If your event is not in there, or does not use those keywords, I will probably miss it. If you want to be sure, submit your event using the "Add Your Event" link at the top of the homepage. Thanks! -Kevin
