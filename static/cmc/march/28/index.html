		<h3>The world today</h3>
		<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/430/very-tough-love">This week's episode of This American Life</a> is about Amanda Williams, a judge in Glynn County, Georgia, who has set up a kangaroo court, handed out 5-10 year sentences for offenses that would get no sentence anywhere else, and who has nearly everyone in the county fearing retribution from her. I highly recommend it, but be warned it is extremely difficult to listen to. You should also listen to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/429/will-they-know-me-back-home">last week's episode</a>, about an Iraqi translator who risked her life for the US Army, earned recommendations from top US brass, and then had her visa turned down when her life and family were at risk, and she tried to move them to the US.<br /><br />
