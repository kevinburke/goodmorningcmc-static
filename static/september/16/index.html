<h3>Athenaeum</h3>

Michael Eisner. Eisner used to be the CEO of Disney. He was CEO for 21 years, until Walt Disney's nephew accused him of micromanagement in 2003 and led a campaign to force him out, which was successful. That probably won't be a conversation topic at the Ath, however.<br><br>

Ath opens at 5 for discussion; dinner is at 6; talk is at 6:45.<br><br>
