<em>Hey guys, I'm still struggling to put the word out about Good Morning CMC. This week I tried getting on the Inform distribution list, but the Dean of Students office wouldn't let me use it. I've also tried the RA's, and (help me) Facebook ads, but your word is still my best advertisement. I really appreciate your help putting the word out, if you enjoy these then please <a name="fb_share" type="icon_link" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fkburke%2Eorg%2Fgoodmorningcmc%2F&t=Good%20Morning%20CMC">Share</a> it or tell your friends. Thanks.</em><br><BR>
