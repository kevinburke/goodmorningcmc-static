It's Friday. If you're going to sleep around a lot and then rate all the guys you slept with on their assets, make sure you don't let <a href="http://jezebel.com/5652114/college-girls-power-point-fuck-list-goes-viral-gallery">the whole Internet see your sex list</a>. On second thought, scratch that. Make sure you're not the <i>second</i> person to have your sex list hit the Internet. Then you're just a copycat.
