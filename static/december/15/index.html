        <h3>Leaving Campus</h3>

        If you are in a dorm, you need to check out before you leave. Get a key envelope from your RA, complete the information, place your room key inside and return the envelope to Story House.<br><br>

        <b>Returning Textbooks</b><br><br>

        There are 3 options for returning textbooks:<bR><br>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161232"><b>Amazon Marketplace</b></a>. By far the deepest market and best prices for your textbook. You will have to ship the book once you sell it however. Amazon has helpful tutorials on their website.<br><br>

        <a href="http://www.collegematchers.com/">College Matchers</a>This site was started by CMC students, no word on quality, but you are helping out a campus entrepreneur by listing your book here.<br><br>

        <b>Resell to Huntley</b> - Huntley really has a bad name among many students for underpaying when buying back textbooks, as well as having long lines. However it is convenient.<br><br>

        <b>Don't Buy Books To Begin With</b> - This is my preferred method. You can get books from the library, or through <a href="http://csul.iii.com">LINK+</a>. If neither of those resources has your book, ask your professor to place a copy of the textbook on reserve at the library at the beginning of the semester. Or, anticipate your own future laziness and don't bother doing any of that.<br><Br>
