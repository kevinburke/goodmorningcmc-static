Two quick notes:<br><br>

So, my friend had a theory that some Snacks are universally disliked and some Snacks are not. Is it true? If you don't want onion rings at Snack, make your voice heard <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGhtaWRBaEtWVDdyQlBvNzd4WHhOX2c6MQ">here.</a><br><br>

Also campus celebrities Patrick Eagan Van Meter and Jacinth Sohi are analyzing the parking situation at CMC. Whether you have a car or not, you should fill out their snazzy survey <a href="https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEtyMDVzenRkOURJUHdnQU5ZU0tMWnc6MQ">here</a>.<br><br>

<h3>Athenaeum</h3>

<!--Dinner: <b>Charles Kamm</b>, assistant professor of music at&nbsp;Scripps, will be conducting the Claremont chamber choir. I&nbsp;signed up for this last year but ended up spending the whole time in the back room of the Ath talking with a girl who worked there, we would have dated but then I went to India and the whole thing went to hell. Anyway, pursue serendipity, because you never know. I&nbsp;hear it's a great concert.

<br><Br>Ath opens at 5:30; dinner starts at 6, and the program begins at 6:45.-->
