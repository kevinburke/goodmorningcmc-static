        Two quick notes: In case you are filling out teacher evaluations today or tomorrow, please take it seriously and don't be afraid to ask for more time to fill it out. Teacher evaluations are the only way teachers are going to learn about problems with their teaching style, and the Dean of Faculty office uses teacher evaluations when it is making tenure decisions. The best way to help is to provide specific feedback, positive or negative, that will help the teacher learn more about their teaching style.<br><br>

        Also, finals are a stressful time but please do not forget your support network - your friends, family, and professionals at CMC, who care about you and will help you finish the semester strong. Seek advice from Dean of Freshmen <a href="mailto:jennifer.marana@claremontmckenna.edu">Jennifer Jimenez Marana</a> or set up an appointment to meet with Monsour Counseling Services. <br><br>
