        <h3>Leaving Campus</h3>

        If you are in a dorm, you need to check out before you leave. Get a key envelope from your RA, complete the information, place your room key inside and return the envelope to Story House.<br><br>

        <b>Returning Textbooks</b><br><br>

        There are 3 options for returning textbooks:<bR><br>

        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161232"><b>Amazon Marketplace</b></a>. By far the deepest market and best prices for your textbook. You will have to ship the book once you sell it however. Amazon has helpful tutorials on their website.<br><br>

        <a href="http://www.collegematchers.com/">College Matchers</a>This site was started by CMC students, no word on quality, but you are helping out a campus entrepreneur by listing your book here.<br><br>

        <b>Resell to Huntley</b> - Huntley really has a bad name among many students for underpaying when buying back textbooks, as well as having long lines. However it is convenient.<br><br>

        <b>Don't Buy Books To Begin With</b> - This is my preferred method. You can get books from the library, or through <a href="http://csul.iii.com">LINK+</a>. If neither of those resources has your book, ask your professor to place a copy of the textbook on reserve at the library at the beginning of the semester. Or, anticipate your own future laziness and don't bother doing any of that.<br><Br>

        New media site Gawker had its server hacked over the weekend, so if you had an account on Gawker, Lifehacker, Deadspin, Jezebel, Gizmodo, or other Gawker site, and you use the same password for your other sites, <a href="http://gawker.com/5712615/commenting-accounts-compromised-++-change-your-passwords">you should really change it now,</a> because your password is floating around the Internet on Bittorrent. The hackers posted all of the details of the hack <a href="http://pastebin.com/cpb7ndV8">here;</a> the owner of Gawker was using "24862486" as his password. That's really stupid and serves as a reminder that you should use hard-to-guess passwords.<br><br>

		It's Monday. The main difference between coffee cake and crumb cake is that the majority of a crumb cake is the crumb topping, whereas a coffee cake has mostly cake with a much smaller topping.
